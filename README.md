# Mobile-Robot-Orientation-and-Position-using-QR-Code

For mobile robots localization, using QR code fixed on the ground and a camera on the robot to scan it is handy. However, getting the orientation of the robot isn't quite straight forward.

This python code does the job of measuring the orientation in degrees from the vertical axis (0 -> 359 degrees), and reading the QR-Code information (position).

This should be integerated easily with ROS.

The code was originally written using jupyter notebook, so a few lines might need to be modified when not using notebook.

The "CVC_Project.html" file show a working example.
